# deep_learning
This repository contains projects and code implementations of core deep learning algorithms, including Single-Layer Perceptrons (SLP), Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP), Backpropagation, and more. Each project showcases key concepts in deep learning, with clean, modular, and well-documented code to support learning and experimentation.
